## Hi there 👋

I'm **Jarvs**, an aspiring **Data Analyst**  based in **Philippines**.

I love turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.

If there's a complex dataset in front of me, I'll dive in to find the hidden trends and tell a story with it.

My main tech stack is **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**, **SQL**, and **matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualization. My favorite tools are **Power BI** and  **Excel**.

I'm constantly learning and practicing. I've completed certificates from **DataCamp**, and I'm always looking for new datasets to explore.
